# Potter Studio
Potter Studio is a AI 3D model generator that takes user's text or image prompts and converts them to textured, detailed, high quality 3D models.
It is currently under development by me and @saintsaturn.

Planned features you can look forward to:
- Open source editor and libraries(not including the Potter AI)
- Text to 3D Model
- Export as .FBX, Wavefront .OBJ, or Blender .BLEND
- Texture and Normal Paint

If you would like to help support Potter's development or if you'd like to help with the programming dm me @rubixgames on discord or go to https://rubixgames.itch.io
